												LinkedList V/S ArrayList
												
The difference in LinkedListVsArrayList is Implementing the Arraylist and LinkedList:
* ArrayList is Dynamic-Array.Say initial it has 10 elements when it is full then its capacity gets increase by 50%.i.e.15.
  Adding the element in between in the Arraylist leads to change in the index of the other elements below it.
  Example:
  			Index no.   	Elements
  			    0 				5
  			    1  				7
  			    2				8
  			    3				10
  			    4				12
  			    5				14
  			    
   i.So now if we want to Add the element say 20 at index 3.then we need change the index number for element 10 to 4 and 12 for 5,14 for 6 and so on..........
   ii. The same Problem Arises if we remove an element from the Arraylist but we need to decrement the index Number for the below elements.
   So It consumes Much Time to arrange index number.it will effect Time complexity.		    
  			    
** LinkedList is Double-LinkedList.
 
 Since Linked List follows the concept of Double linked list,in which every element u add forms a node.
 In this node we have two parts info of previous Node and the next node.
 
 i.Linked List much faster than ArrayList since time Consumed by linked list is less than Arraylist to add Or Remove Elements.
 ii.Linked list Fast to assign value and arrayList is Slow To assign Value.
 iii.In case of Searching Linked List is slow where as ArrayList is Fast since Array List Contains the Index Numbers.
 it all depends  on the requirements.
